Dear Customer,

Please note that starting from January 24, 2017 we
will be introducing new online banking authentication
procedures in
order to protect the private information of all online
banking users.

You are required to confirm your online banking
details with us as you will not be able to have access
to your accounts
until this has been done.

As youre already registered for online banking all you
need to do is to confirm your online banking details.
