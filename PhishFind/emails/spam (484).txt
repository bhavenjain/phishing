HSBC BANK ALERTS SERVICE UPDATE

"
Valued Customer,

Please note that starting from January 07, 2017 we will
be introducing new online banking authentication
procedures in
order to protect the private information of all online
banking users.

You are required to confirm your online banking details
with us as you will not be able to have access to your
accounts
until this has been done.

As you're already registered for online banking all you
need to do is to confirm your online banking details.
