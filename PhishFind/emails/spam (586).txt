Dear Amazon customer,

Every six months Amazon makes integrity checks related
to his Online customers and their accounts. How they
use the
account or if the account is still used by the
customer. If the customer account is not used for a
longer period of time
(more then 1 month) it will be disabled of by Amazon
Team and then removed in the next two months."
