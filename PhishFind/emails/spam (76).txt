Review Update	30th January 2019
AOL Mail (New Terms)

"
Hi AOL User,

Our community and vision for your mail experience have
grown significantly, so we’re updating our Terms of
Service,
Payments Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy
(collectively, “TERMS”). The Terms will go into
effect for all
existing users on January 29, 2019. When you use AOL on
or after that day, we’ll ask you to agree to the new
Terms of
Service and your continued use of the AOL Platform from
that day on will be subject to the new Privacy Policy.
