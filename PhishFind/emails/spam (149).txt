Dear rgwalker99@aol.com,

A deactivation request was made by you yesterday at
exactly 15.09pm to completely close down your Amazon
account. We
are attending to the request and soon we will close the
account as requested.

If you did not make this request and you think you are
receiving this message mistakenly, Update Now and
update your
Amazon in order to keep your account intact, otherwise
your account will be shut down.

We hope to see you again soon.

AM..."
