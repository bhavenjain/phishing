IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR AOL - EMAIL SERVICE

ERROR! FILENAME NOT SPECIFIED.

Hello,

As you've used your email address in the last 90 days,
we need to let you know about some changes we're
making.

We're closing some of our older email services. That
means your AOL email address will stop working after
23rd Sept,
2019 unless you switch to AOL OATH. If you don't,
you'll lose your email address as well as the folders
and messages
associated with it...."
