Natwest Security

Dear barryj.osborne@tiscali.co.uk,

At Natwest your security is very important to us, so
you will be glad to hear that Natwest online banking
has been
updated with new security measures added to make your
account safer. We need all Online Banking users to
verify their
Online Banking User details for the measures to be
properly effective, so until you have done this your
online banking
will be disabled.

Please log in to your online banking.
